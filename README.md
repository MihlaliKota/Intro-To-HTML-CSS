## Unit 1: Intro To HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used in all froms of web technology. It is used for content output such as words, images, video, audio, forms and interactive experiences. It is a solid foundation for everything in the digital realm.

The same way humans can communicate with each other through language, computers can also speak to each other through, what we call, programming languages. These programming languages are very consistent and logical in nature. Through practice and methodical learning, humans can learn these programming languages and create websites, applications, software and all sorts of creations. The internet is where computers and humans intersect and communicate with each other. 

Even though we can learn what programming languages are, how to understand them and how to even use them, computers can't necessarily fully understand humans due complex languages, nuances and countless words that are being created on a daily. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the solution to this problem. AI allows computers understand human communication on the web. 

Now HTML is somewhat the same as AI in the function to minimize complexity between humans and computers. HTML allows us to bridge the gap between human and programming languages. Think of it like a skeleton on a human body. Without bones none of us would be able to walk, run or do anything for that matter. We need bones for our bodies to function and perform the way it does, the same way we need HTML for websites, applications and software.
